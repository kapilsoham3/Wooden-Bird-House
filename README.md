# Wooden-Bird-House 
In this projec I created a Bird House using 2 large  wooden planks. Before making the Bird House, I created an Isometric and an Orthographic diagram of the Birdhouse on paper. I also made a diagram where I divided the wooden planks into different parts of the bird houses and labeled the dimentions of each part. I measured the my final bird house to ensure it matches the dimentions in the diagram. My actual dimentions were a few millimeter less than the dimentions in my design. This could be because of measuring error or sanding causing slight mismatch on the actual dimentions. I later stained my birdhouse. The hole in my bird house was smaller than a typical birdhouse, but I made this way since I wanted my birdhouse to be more of a decorative piece than an actual birdhouse.
